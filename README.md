In this project we will carry out some simulations with various SIR-related models on a network. 

### What's in here?
Here you can find:
- the notebook `Epidemy_simulations.ipynb` with all the relevant code and comments
- some auxiliary functions in the file `auxiliary_functions.py``
- the dataset `edges-13.csv`.
- some presentation slides `slide.pdf`

### Dataset
The dataset we used is a simple graph whose edges and nodes can be obtained from the file `edges-13.csv`.

### Disclamair 
This project was part of a course of Digital Epidemiology and Precision Medicin at Sapienza University of Rome held by Prof. M. Petti, Prof. S. Guarino (from CNR) and Prof. E. Mastrostefano (from CNR)
